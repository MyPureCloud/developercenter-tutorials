- title: Introduction
  content: |
    Campaigns are the workhorses for outbound dialing. Before you can create a campaign, you'll need to have [created a contact list](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/tutorials/create-contact-list/#javascript) and, for most dialing modes, a queue. Most dialing modes also require a script, but you can use the default outbound script that's provided.

    First, the user must authorize the application.

    Next, the IDs of the desired contact list, queue, and agent script are retrieved. This is accomplished by collecting the promises from the API requests and waiting until all have resolved before moving on to the next step.

    The IDs collected in the previous step are then used to populate the campaign configuration object. This object is then used to create the campaign. This is a bare-bones configuration for a preview dialing campaign. More information about dialing modes and their options can be found on the [Outbound Dialing API Resource documentation](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/rest/v2/outbound/index.html) under POST /api/v2/outbound/campaigns.
