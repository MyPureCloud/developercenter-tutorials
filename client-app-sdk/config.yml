    This tutorial walks through the steps of integrating a web app with the [Genesys Cloud Client App SDK](/api/client-apps/) and the [Genesys Cloud Platform SDK](/api/rest/client-libraries/javascript/index.html). 
    
    The Client App SDK grants web applications access to unique functionalities when they're embedded as a Client App Integration or Interaction Widget.

    The Javascript Platform SDK provides a way to consume the Genesys Cloud Platform API which is used in general purpose integrations with Genesys Cloud.

    This tutorial shows how to set-up a simple integration using the two SDKs.

- title: Referencing the Library
  content: |
    Provide a reference to both libraries.

    The Platform SDK supports the `latest` tag while the Client App SDK requires the semver version value.

- title: URL Interpolation to determine pcLangTag and pcEnvironment
  content: |
    Pre-Requisites:

    * The configured app should have a URL defining the pcLangTag and pcEnvironment tags

    ```
    ex. https://myapp.com?language={pcLangTag}&environment={pcEnvironment}
    ```

    This will contain information on the user's locale and which environment they are running and will look similarly to:

    ```
    https://myapp.com?language=en-us&environment=mypurecloud.com
    ```

    After acquiring both the environment and language values from the query parameters, they will be persisted using the localStorage. This is important because in the Implicit Grant Authentication step, the page will be redirected without the query parameters values.

    Once the page reloads and there are no query parameters, then it will attempt to reassign both the environment and language variables with the values that are stored in the localStorage.

- title: Setting up the Client SDK
  content: |
    A ClientApp instance needs to be created with the correct environment for its configuration.

    For more information on the Client App SDK, go to this [page](/api/client-apps/sdk/index.html/)

- title: Implicit Grant Authentication
  content: |
    In order to use the Genesys Cloud API, an implicit grant authentication needs to be accomplished. After authentication it should redirect to the URL in the redirectUri variable.

    For more information on authorization see this [page](/api/rest/authorization/)

- title: Toast Popup
  content: |
    After setting up both the Client App SDK and the Platform SDK, they can now be used to their full advantages.

    In this example, we use the Platform SDK to query the user details and then, using the Client App SDK, show a Toast up in order to greet them.
