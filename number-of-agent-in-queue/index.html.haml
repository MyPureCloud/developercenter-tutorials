        :markdown
			This tutorial walks throught the steps of implementing a function to get the number of On-Queue Agents on a specific queue.
			
			There are 5 tpes of Routing Status: IDLE, INTERACTING, COMMUNINCATING, OFF_QUEUE, and NOT_RESPONDING. To determine if an agent is On-Queue, he/she should have a routing status of either IDLE or INTERACTING.
			
			Go here for more information about [Presences and Routing Status](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/rest/v2/presence/understanding_presence.html):
            
			For this tutorial, we are going to use the Python PureCloud SDK.

    .step{:data=>{:title=>'Obtain an Access Token'}}
        :markdown
            Start by making a POST call to https://login.mypurecloud.com/oauth/token with the following settings:
            * Authentication- Basic
            * User - Client ID
            * Password-  Client secret

            To use basic authentication, set the authentication header to ```Basic <base64EncodedUserPass>```, where base64EncodedUserPass is a base64-encoded string containing the username and password separated by a colon:
              base64.b64encode(bytes(client_id + ':' + client_secret, 'ISO-8859-1')).decode('ascii')
			
            Note: Base64 encoding differs between Python 2 and Python 3. This implementation is for Python 3.

    .step{:data=>{:title=>'Create instance of Routing API'}}
        :markdown
            Configure the token to be used by the PureCloud SDK. This token will be sent along every API call automatically.
			
			Create an instance of the Routing API which will be used to make the API calls.
	.step{:data=>{:title=>'Create the function'}}
        :markdown
            First, search for the queue using its name. It should return exactly one result, otherwise it should return an exception.
			
			The next API call should get the users of the queue with the desired routing status. ("IDLE", "INTERACTING").
			
			The number of users will simple be returned from the function.
