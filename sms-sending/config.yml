    The main objective of this tutorial is to showcase how to create an interaction, and send SMS through a queue with Platform API. The given sample code will send a message after an agent drops off a call. This tutorial will also cover how to create a notification channel, subscribe to a topic and listen to a web socket.

- title: Create a Notification Channel 
  content: |
    Create a notification channel and subscribe to the topic `{"id": "v2.routing.queues.{queueID}.conversations.calls"}`. This topic will listen to a queues incoming and outgoing calls. After setting up the notification channel, create a web socket object using the notification channel URI.
- title: Recieving Notification
  content: |
    Every time a call connects to the queue a notification will be sent to the web socket. In this sample code, _if statements_ is used to filter through the messages the websocket is recieving. To identify if the caller is using a mobile number, an IVR is created that prompt the user to identify if he is using a mobile number. The customers input will be in the participant attribute. This is one of many ways to check if a caller is using a mobile number. 
    An attribute is also added to the customers information after a message is sent, this is done later on the codes. This will be filtered too, to avoid sending multiple SMS to the customer.
