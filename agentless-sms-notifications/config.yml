- title: Introduction
  content: |
    This tutorial will explain how to use Genesys Cloud public api to send agentless outbound sms notifications and invoke them from another system.

- title: Create or use an existing OAuth client.
  content: |
    You will need an OAuth client with the `Conversation:Message:Create` permission assigned to the OAuth client. See: https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-an-oauth-client/ for more info

- title: Generate an OAuth client token
  content: |
    In order to call the endpoint to send agentless outbound sms notifications you will need to use your OAuth client to generate a token. See: https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/rest/authorization/use-client-credentials.html for more info


- title: Use the OAuth client token to call the agentless outbound sms endpoint
  content: |
    Using the public api you will need to call the POST /api/v2/conversations/messages/agentless to send the message. Use the previously generated Oauth client token as "Authoization: Bearer {OAuthClientToken}"" header in the request. The POST body should look like this
    ```{"language":"json"}
    {
     "fromAddress": "", //An already provisioned sms number provisioned in the org
     "toAddress": "", //The e164 formatted number you are sending the notification to
     "toAddressMessengerType": "sms",
     "textBody": "" //The text body of the notification to send
    }
    ```

    The response body will look like the following
    ```{"language":"json"}
    {
        "id": "", //Id of the message
        "conversationId": "", //The conversation id that was used to send the message
        "fromAddress": "", //The from address used from the request body
        "toAddress": "", //The to address used from the request body
        "messengerType": "", //The messenger type used from the request body
        "textBody": "", //The text body used from the request body
        "timestamp": "2019-12-12T14:11:08.458Z", //The time the sms notification was sent
        "selfUri": "" //self uri for this message Id
    }
    ```
