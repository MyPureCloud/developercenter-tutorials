- title: Introduction
  content: |
    There might be scenarios where contact records need to be individually added to a campaign.

    For more information on the Dialer APIs see the [REST Documentation](http://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/rest/v2/outbound/index.html)
- title: Adding Record to Contact List
  content: |
    The data field of the contact is a hash of contact list column and the value where the key is the call list column name.
- title: Restart the campaign
  content: |
    Campaigns will most likely need to be restarted after contacts are added.  We first get the current campaign configuration, then we will set campaignStatus to "on" and update the campaign.

    It is important to get the campaign details first because there is a version on the campaign and the data that you post to the server needs to have the same version as the current version in the system.

    If the campaign is already running, you won't have to start it for the contacts to be dialed.
