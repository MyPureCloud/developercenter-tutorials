- title: Introduction
  content: |
    This tutorial walks through the steps to download recordings in bulk within a given date interval.
    For this tutorial, Genesys Cloud SDK will be used.
- title: Input
  content: |
    For this tutorial, the user will be asked to input the credentials through a simple console input.

    The user will be also asked for the date interval of the recordings. Please take note of the format for the date input YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss/YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.
- title: Configure SDK Settings
  content: |
    Next is the configuration of SDK setting by providing an access token which will be used in processing API calls.

    To obtain a token, separate function is created to request token from Genesys Cloud.
- title: Obtain an Access Token
  content: |
    Start by making a POST call to https://login.mypurecloud.com/oauth/token to request a token.
    Some SDKs will include helper functions to obtain the token using the Client ID and Client Secret, while on other SDKs, the HTTP Request and Response needs to be manually handled to obtain the token.

    For this tutorial, Client Credentials Grant Type will be used as user context is not needed in acquiring the desired information
    More information about OAuth and Authorization could be found in the [documentation](/api/rest/authorization/).

- title: Instantiate APIs
  content: |
    Instance of Conversation API and Recording API will be created and will be passed to methods that will request for the batch download.

    To get the recordings, separated functions were created
    * Get Conversation IDs within a date interval
    * Use the Conversation IDs and and Recording IDs and request a batch download for the conversations
    * Get all conversations with recordings
    * Determine the file extension to be used depending on the contenttype
    * Download recordings

- title: Get Conversation IDs
  content: |
    Before getting the recordings within the date interval, conversations that happened during the dates should be get first.

    Here, a function is created to get all conversations with the date interval as the search criteria.

    The function should return the Conversation ID of the conversation which will be used in requesting the batch download of the recordings.

    Starting December 9, 2020, [POST /api/v2/analytics/conversations/details/query](/api/rest/v2/analytics/#post-api-v2-analytics-conversations-details-query) will allow querying for interval start dates up to 35 days in the past (including today) and will return a maximum of 10,000 records per query.

    * The [POST /api/v2/analytics/conversations/details/query](/api/rest/v2/analytics/#post-api-v2-analytics-conversations-details-query) function accepts a search interval that does not exceed 7 days.
    * We recommend using the [POST /api/v2/analytics/conversations/details/jobs](/api/rest/v2/analytics/#post-api-v2-analytics-conversations-details-jobs) for any historical queries.
    * The [POST /api/v2/analytics/conversations/details/query](/api/rest/v2/analytics/#post-api-v2-analytics-conversations-details-query) function has a default to return 25 conversations. Use the `paging` property to customize the `pageSize` and the `pageNumber`.
      * pageSize - How many results per page
      * pageNumber - How many pages in

    ```{"language":"json"}
    {
      "interval": "2019-09-03T16:00:00.000Z/2019-09-10T16:00:00.000Z",
      "paging": {
        "pageSize": 300,
        "pageNumber": 1
      }
    }
    ```

- title: Request Batch Recordings Download
  content: |
    Create a function that will get all recordings of the conversations.

    The function should return the Job ID which will be used to download the recordings.

- title: Get Recording Extension Based on Conversation Media
  content: |
    Create a function that will set the file extension based on the conversation media.

    The function should return file extension depending on the contenttype.

- title: Download Recordings into a Directory
  content: |
    Create a function that will download each conversation recordings and save it in a directory.

    Take note that archived recordings will only display error message and will not be downloaded.
