- title: Input
  content: |
    For this tutorial, the user will be asked to input the conversation ID.
- title: Authenticate with Genesys Cloud
  content: |
    Using Client Credentials OAuth, authenticate to Genesys Cloud using loginClientCredentialsGrant. 
    
    More information about OAuth and Authorization could be found in the [documentation](/api/rest/authorization/).
- title: Instantiate APIs
  content: |
    Instance of Conversation API and Speech and Text Analytics API will be created.

- title: Get Conversation Details
  content: |
    Before getting the voice transcript, we will need to know the Communication ID of a voice interaction.

    This function gets the Communication ID by calling the getConversation function of the Conversation API. Once we have the Communication ID, we will then call the getSentimentScore and getTranscriptUrl.

- title: Get Sentiment Score
  content: |
    This function gets the Sentiment Score by calling the getSpeechandtextanalyticsConversation function of the Speech and Text Analytics API and passing the Conversation ID.

    A successful response returns a JSON object in this format:
    ```{"language":"json"}
    {
      "conversation": {
        "id": "",
        "selfUri": ""
      },
      "sentimentScore": 0,
      "sentimentTrend": 0
    }
    ```

- title: Get Transcript URL
  content: |
    This function gets the S3 URL of the voice transcript by calling the getSpeechandtextanalyticsConversationCommunicationTranscripturl function of the Speech and Text Anallytics API and passing the Conversation ID and the Communication ID.

    A successful response returns a JSON object in this format:
    ```{"language":"json"}
    {
      "url": ""
    }
    ```

- title: Consuming the S3 URL
  content: |
    The transcript can be accessed by going to the URL returned by the getSpeechandtextanalyticsConversationCommunicationTranscripturl function.

    To consume this JSON object, we will need to use the fetch library to display the voice transcript in our application.

- title: Identify the Agent and the Customer
  content: |
    You can identify the agent and the customer in the transcripts.phrases.participantPurpose property. The participant is the Agent if the value is `internal`, and the customer if the value is `external`.
