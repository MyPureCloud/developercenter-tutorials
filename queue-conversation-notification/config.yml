    In order to subscribe to a queue, we need to call the postNotificationsChannelSubscriptions() method of the Notifications API of the JavaScript Genesys Cloud SDK passing the Channel ID variable from the postNotificationsChannels() method call.

    The Topic ID used in this tutorial the following where the queue variable stores the queueId.

    ```
    "v2.routing.queues.{queueId}.conversations"

    To make sure that we are getting the correct notifications, we need to check if the websocket message contains the same Topic ID we used when subscribing to the queue.

    Once the Topic ID has been validated, we can now proceed in consuming the conversation details however the app needs us to do.
